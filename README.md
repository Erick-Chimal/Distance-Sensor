<h1>Distance Sensor</h1>

<!-- ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtu.be/7eJexJVCqJo) -->

<h2>Description</h2>
Developing a machine that can detect the distance of an object using C++ is an ambitious project. The coding must be precise for the desired effect. Not only does working with C++ require an in-depth understanding of the language, but the machine itself must be able to differentiate between objects and be able to calculate the distance accurately. Taking all of these challenges into consideration, this type of machine is not only achievable, but can provide a great deal of benefit to those who use it.
